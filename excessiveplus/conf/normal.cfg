/* Weapon Settings
 *
 * Common settings:
 *
 * - Cycle                 Weapon reload time
 *
 * - Self Knockback Cycle  Special weapon reload time coming along with self knockback
 *                         received within one server frame after shot (two frames for bfg
 *                         grenades). If not specified, value is taken from Cycle setting
 *
 * - Damage                Amount of damage inflicted
 *
 * - Knockback             Damage and Knockback have been separated. You can have high damage
 *                         weapons but disable or lower the pushing effect. A negative value
 *                         will pull the player instead of pushing him. If not specified,
 *                         value is taken from Damage setting
 *
 * - Radius                Radius to apply to splash damage and for within splash and self
 *                         knockback have effect
 *
 * - Splash Damage         Max amount of splash damage to inflict, real damage will vary 
 *                         depending on the distance of the enemy to the explosion
 *
 * - Splash Knockback      Max amount of splash knockback to apply to other players. If not
 *                         specified, value is taken from Splash Damage setting
 *
 * - Self Knockback        Amount of splash knockback to apply only to self. A positive value
 *                         means radial knockback, whereas a negative value means a fixed value
 *                         regardless of the distance of the explosion. If not specified,
 *                         value is taken from Splash Knockback setting
 *
 * - Self Knockback HV     Horizontal/Vertical asymmetry control for the Self Knockback
 *                         It may vary in range [1...0...-1] and that is equivalent to
 *                         [just horizontal...symmetric...just vertical] knockback proportion
 *
 * - Self Slide Factor     Multiplier to the time to slide with no control, no friction
 *                         and no gravity after being kicked by self
 *
 * - Self Knockback Multi Jumps
 *                         Multiple Air-Jumps you are guaranteed to have (at least but not
 *                         more than Multi Jumps) being knocked back by self
 *
 * - Firing Knockback      Amount of knockback to apply to self when firing the gun, wich 
 *                         produces a kick effect
 *
 * - Firing Knockback HV   Horizontal/Vertical asymmetry control for the Firing Knockback.
 *                         Range and meanings see the Self Knockback HV description.
 *                         While standing on ground the vertical portion of firing knockback
 *                         will be not greater than (limited to) its horizontal portion
 *
 * - Team Knockback        Same as Knockback but applied to your teammates when you attack them.
 *                         If specified, it will replace the Knockback for the team attack
 *
 * - Team Splash Knockback Same as Splash Knockback but applied to your teammates when you 
 *                         attack them. If specified, it will replace the Splash Knockback
 *                         for the team attack
 *
 * - Ammo                  Amount of ammo to spawn for with that weapon
 *
 * - Ammo Limit            Limit ammo pickups up to this value
 *
 * - Regen                 Number of milliseconds for which to regenerate 1 ammo unit up to

 *
 * - Sky                   If enabled, the weapon and missiles will hit the sky/black box
 *
 * - Weight                Weitgh of the weapon. Player Speed = Player Speed / Weapon Weight
 *
 * - Bounce                Number of times to bounce the shots/missiles before they explode.
 *                         A value of -1 will bounce max times alowed by the mod
 *
 * - Speed                 Only for missiles. Speed at which missiles move
 *
 * - Gravity               Only for missiles. If enabled, the missile will be affected by
 *                         gravity
 *
 * - Time To Live          Only for missiles. Number of seconds for the missile to run before
 *                         it explodes
